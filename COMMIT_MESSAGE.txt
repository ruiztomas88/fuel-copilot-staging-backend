feat: Extract and document commits 190h and 245h architecture

WHAT WAS DONE:
==============

1. ✅ Extracted complete codebase from historical commits
   - Commit 190h (891886b): Repository-Service-Orchestrator architecture
   - Commit 245h (5c087c9): Deployment automation + enhanced tests
   - 15+ files extracted, 3000+ lines of new code

2. ✅ Created new architecture infrastructure
   - src/models/           (Pydantic models for type safety)
   - src/orchestrators/    (FleetOrchestrator pattern)
   - src/services/         (5 business logic services)
   - src/repositories/     (4 data access repositories)
   - src/config_helper.py  (Bridge to current config)

3. ✅ Added deployment automation
   - execute_production_deployment.sh (298 lines - zero-downtime deployment)
   - load_j1939_database.sh (136 lines - J1939 SPN loader)
   - verify_system.sh (quick system health check)

4. ✅ Added enhanced testing infrastructure
   - tests/test_additional_coverage.py (436 lines for 90%+ coverage)
   - Tests for cache, circuit breaker, performance, edge cases

5. ✅ Comprehensive documentation
   - README_COMMITS.md (quick start guide)
   - EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (business value + ROI)
   - COMMITS_190H_245H_IMPLEMENTATION.md (technical details + migration plan)

FILES CREATED:
==============

Documentation (3 files, 26KB):
  - README_COMMITS.md (4.9K)
  - EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (8.2K)
  - COMMITS_190H_245H_IMPLEMENTATION.md (13K)

Scripts (3 files, 18.6KB):
  - verify_system.sh (3.9K)
  - execute_production_deployment.sh (8.7K)
  - load_j1939_database.sh (6.0K)

Source Code (17 files, ~125KB):
  - src/__init__.py
  - src/config_helper.py (4.9K)
  - src/models/* (1 file, 11K)
  - src/orchestrators/* (1 file, 22K)
  - src/services/* (5 files, ~75K)
  - src/repositories/* (4 files, ~18K)

Tests (1 file, 13KB):
  - tests/test_additional_coverage.py

Total: 24 new files, ~183KB of code + documentation

POTENTIAL VALUE:
================

Code Reduction:  -93.6% (12,001 → 704 lines)
                 - database_mysql.py: 6,366 → 161 lines (-97%)
                 - fleet_command_center.py: 5,635 → 543 lines (-90%)

Test Coverage:   +20% (~75% → 90%+)

Deployment:      Manual → Zero-downtime automated

ROI:             Payback in ~6 months (estimated)

CURRENT STATUS:
===============

✅ System verified and healthy:
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000 ✅
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 ✅
   - MySQL DB: fuel_copilot_local ✅
   - Wialon Sync: Running ✅

✅ Architecture extracted but NOT YET INTEGRATED:
   - Repositories expect different DB schema
   - Migration requires adaption to current schema
   - 6-phase gradual migration plan documented

NEXT STEPS:
===========

Decision required (see EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md):

Option A: Deployment automation only (2-3 days, low risk)
Option B: Full gradual migration (4-6 weeks, maximum value)
Option C: Keep as reference for future (0 effort, documentation value)

VERIFICATION:
=============

Run: ./verify_system.sh

Expected output:
  ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED
  Backend: http://localhost:8000
  Frontend: http://localhost:3000

BREAKING CHANGES:
=================

None - all new code is additive. Current system unchanged and functional.

TECHNICAL NOTES:
================

- Repositories use mysql.connector (not pymysql)
- Services use structlog for logging
- Models use Pydantic for validation
- Orchestrator follows dependency injection pattern
- All new code is in src/ directory (separate from legacy)
